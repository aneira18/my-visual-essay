# YOGA 
Practiced by over 300 million people, yoga is the discipline through which one may experience the transcendence of the physical into the boundless Reality.  The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit "yuj" meaning "union".  This union refers to the uniting of body, mind, and spirit and also the union of experiencing everything in the universe as part of one's self, the one and only Self.  Yoga is a holistic system for self-transformation on every plane, whether that be physical or nonphysical, that improves health, mental health and deepens spiritual belief.

## Map

Yoga originated in ancient India.  The earliest evidence of yoga lies with the Indus-Sarasvati civilization in Northern India almost 5,000 years ago, but many claim that yoga was developed even earlier.

# THE UPANISHADS
"As a spider emits and withdraws a web, as plants grow from the soil, and as hair grows over the human body, so does the universe spring out from the eternal Brahman." [1.1.7]

# PURPOSE
The purpose of yoga is not for inner peace, physical exercise, or flexiblity.  It is to elevate your consciousness in order to become one with the divine, or Higher Self, and to break the cycle of Samsara, or cyclic existence.  The history of humanity can be broken down into four yugas, or stages of human existence, which repeat cyclically.  In the first yuga, or Satya yuga, humanity is full of virture, love, purity, and devotion.  In the second yuga, or Treta yuga, there is a decline in these values and in the condition of the world.  In the third yuga, or Dvapara yuga, there is another decline.  Lastly, in the fourth yuga or Kali yuga, there is another decline.  Humanity is in its lowest state, living in the ego rather than living in the soul.  There is wide-scale suffering and confusion, with people chasing temporary pleasures rather than everlasting bliss.  This is the yuga we are living in currently.
However, the cycle of the four yugas is not the cycle of Samsara.  Samsara is the cycle of rebirth.  When one dies, depending on the karma accumulated throughout their lifetime, they may elevate or be reborn into a new incarnation.  By elevate, I mean that they may live on in the higher spiritual realms where they will continue to learn about the universe and grow until they attain oneness with the divine Creator.  Through the yogic path, one may break free of the cycle of Samsara and attain the higher spiritual planes of existence.

# ONENESS
Within everyone is the eternal soul of the ultimate God, or Higher Consciousness.  This is called the Atman, which is one with the larger Brahman.  Through yoga and meditation, one may tap into this to attain turiya, or a complete merging with the Divine Consciousness during which one loses all sense of ego.  The specific personality and sense of self in each person is called the Jivatman.  Turiya involves loss of the sense of Jivatman.  You are Brahman, and Brahman is you.  You are everything and everything is you.  There is no differentiation between you and the universe, because they are synonymous.  Your soul moves with the waves of the ocean, the beams of moonlight, and the shifting sands of the desert.  Realization of this leads to infinite bliss.  However, bliss is not an emotion, but a state of being.  You are not blissful about something, but rather existing in bliss.  Through yoga and meditation, one may reach this state of bliss while still confined by the body.

# THE MACHINE
The body is your temple and your vehicle in which to navigate this universe.  It consists of five koshas, or sheaths, which can be imagined as the physical body (annamaya), energetic body (pranamaya), mind body (manomaya), consciousness body (vijnanamaya), and bliss body (anandamaya).  Within the heart lies the Atman, or soul, which is the subtlest of all and pervades everything and is synonymous with the divine Creator.  There are seven main chakras, or energy centers, and 72,000 nadis, or lesser energy centers through which prana flows.  The body is fueled by prana, or vital life force, generated by breath.  Prana enters the left and right nostrils up to between the eyebrows and travels around the spine in two currents, the ida and pingala.  Ida being associated with the moon and pingala being associated with the sun.  They twirl around the center current, the sushumna, which runs down to the base of the spine where the kundalini is.  The kundalini is a coiled, powerful goddess energy that can be awakened and lifted through the seven chakras to meet with the god energy at the crown of the head for spiritual awakening.  There are five currents or winds (vayus) of prana that serve different functions in the body: prana, apana, samana, udana, and vyana.  For example, Udana serves upward movement in the body such as speech, and apana serves downward movement in the body such as elimination.  Through asana and pranayama, one may manipulate the flow of prana throughout the body.

# ASANA
Asana is the flow of yoga postures from one to the other and can refer to each posture indiviudally.  Some examples of asanas would be downward dog (svanasana), child's pose (balasana), lotus pose (padmasana), or the corpse pose (shavasana).  These poses are used to manipulate energy throughout the body and may bring about change.  It is the divine alignment of the body.  For example, when you sit up straight, you instantly feel more confident and awake.  Asana may help the flow of prana throughout the body which may remove energetic blockages.

# PRANAYAMA
Pranyama is breathwork which manipulates the flow of prana throughout the body.  Prana can be thought of as a subtle, life-giving energy that animates our bodies.  It cannot be sensed by sight, smell, hearing, taste, or touch, but can be sensed with the mind deep in meditation.  During yoga, one may use different types of pranayama.  One of these is ujayyi which is also known as ocean breath or victory breath.  It involves clenching the throat during inhalation to produce a ocean wave sound until the chest is full and then entails breath retention for a period of seconds before a long exhale.  During the flow of asanas, a yoga practitioner inhales on the assumation of the pose and exhales on the surrender into the pose.

# MEDITATION
There is a vast multitude of purposes for meditation.  Meditation allows one to quiet the swirling thoughts, limitations, and constructs of the mind in order to tap into the Atman, or Brahman, or Divine Consciousness of the universe for self-actualization and enlightenment.  Meditation has many mental health and physical health benefits, but its primary purpose is for alignment with the divine and transcending the ego.  By transcending the ego and connecting with the divine, one may achieve the Diving Being Bliss.  This enlightenment can be considered a liberation from the human condition, allowing one to find and live in Bliss through any facet of life or hardship.

There is also a vast multitude of meditation methods.  Some of these include dharana, dhyana, and samadhi.  Dharana, dhyana, and samadhi are consecutive.  Dharana involves directing the focus to an object, dhyana involves fixed, sustained focus and concentration on the object, and samadhi involves complete mental absoprtion into the object where there is no differentiation between mind and object.

# AYURVEDA
Ayurveda is an ancient Indian medicine and lifestyle doctrine.  According to ayurveda, there is three doshas, or body types ruled by the elements.

The third is kapha which is ruled by water and is characterized by a larger frame and resting weight.

Specific diets are established for each dosha which are divided into tastes.  For example, one reccomendation for pitta is to avoid spicy foods because spice can aggravate the metabolic fire of the pitta and create an inbalance with vata and kapha.  Diet reccomendations are instilled to protect the balance between the elements.  
Ayurveda also consists of a specific daily routine.  Ayurvedic practitioners start their day with usual dental hygiene, adding on the use of a tongue scraper to cleanse the mouth of toxins accumuulated during sleep.  Oil-pulling is a method used to cleanse the mouth as well which involves swishing the mouth with natural oils such as sesame oil or coconut oikl.  Abhyanga, or self-massage, is incorporated once a day which stimulates the lymphatic system to release toxins and cleanse the body.  Abhyanga consists of a specific massage method, beginning at the ends of extremities and working one's way to the center of the body using back-and-forth motions on limbs and circular motions on the joints.  Abhyanga involved the use of natural massage oils such as sesame oil or coconut oil.  An ayurvedic life also consists of following the path of yoga.
